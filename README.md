### Info ###
* Hands-on project for the R.S. course at Politecnico di Milano, written in C#.
* The goal of the competition was to predict a set of jobs for many target users, based on the record of past jobs looked at by each user. The application domain was a professional social network, where users look for open job positions.
* Were applied several predictions algorithms such as Content Based (CB), Collaborative Filtering (CF), TF/IDF, KNN and Hybrids ones.

### How does it work ###
* Receives as input some csv datasets (of user profiles and interactions)
* Executes ML algorithms
* Gives in output a list of predicted jobs of each target user

### Report ###
* Pdf of the final report available in the related folder
